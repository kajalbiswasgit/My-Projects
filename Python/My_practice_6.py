#Task Name: ðŸšŒ Bus Ticket Booking System
"""
Show the user a list of available bus routes.
Ask the passenger to enter the route they want, but allow them to type in short forms
(e.g., "kol-del" should be converted to "Kolkata to Delhi").
Ask for passenger names (multiple names separated by commas).
Clean the input by removing extra spaces and capitalizing names properly.
Use join() to display passenger names in one line.
Use format() to print a ticket receipt."""
